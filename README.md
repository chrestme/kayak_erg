Code to run an MSP430 as a peripheral to capture hall-effect sensor events.

The hall-effect sensor measures the RPMs of a flywheel for a kayak erg, and will also be used to measure acceleration/deceleration to calculate stroke rate and force of drag. 

In turn, these values allow us to calculate speed, power output, and other workout-related parameters.
